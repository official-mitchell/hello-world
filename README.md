# hello-world
## Learning github to figure out what's the hubbub.

A bit about me, I am not a developer by training, but I want to commit every morsel and ounce my willpower to devote myself to becoming one. I've had enough of not being to implement on all the ideas that keep me up at night and trying to rely on others to do the work for me. I am about to dive deep into this world and I want you to be able to follow my story. You can see more about my work here on my [Medium](https://medium.com/@mopa), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mopatow), and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mitchell-opatowsky-43a615110/).

My attack plan looks like this: I envision myself becoming competent over the next year with JavaScript, Golang, Python, and Solidity. As Edgar Degas said: "Painting is easy when you don't know how, but very difficult when you do."
